# Questions and Answers API

### Optimized backend API utilizing a MySQL database that was designed to handle high-traffic

#### By Maggie Saldivia **{Maggie-Mango}**

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Redis
* Node
* MySQL
* Express
* NGINX Load Balancer


## Description

I built the server and database for a single API service which supports an E-commerce application. This service utilizes the following scaling techniques in order to handle large quanties of data and traffic: **load balancing**, **caching**, **indexing**, **additional AWS EC2 Instances** and **clustering**. 

Post-optimization, this service is able to handle **5,000 requests per second with a 30% error rate**


## Project Documentation
The course of this project was documented thoroughly in my Notion journal.

Screenshot demonstrating that the API can easily handle 1,000 reqs per second
